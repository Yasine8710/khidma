# Security

Reporting vulnerabilities: see the root [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Principles
- **The database is the security boundary.** The app can be modified or replaced by an attacker; Postgres Row Level Security (RLS), grants and privileged functions must be correct on their own. Router redirects and hidden buttons are UX only.
- **Deny by default.** Supabase grants every new public table to `anon` and `authenticated` by default. Every migration revokes everything first and grants the minimum.
- **No secrets in the app.** Only the Supabase URL and the public (publishable or legacy anon) key ship in the client. `app_config.dart` refuses `sb_secret_...` and `service_role` keys at startup.
- **Identity facts never come from client-controlled data.** Roles are not read from `user_metadata` / sign-up metadata, and admin is a row in a table no client can reach.

## Roles and capabilities
| Concept | Where it lives | Who can change it |
|---|---|---|
| Customer / professional | `profiles.is_customer`, `profiles.is_professional` (a user can be both) | `become_professional()` only (a column grant blocks direct edits) |
| Admin | row in `admin_users` | service role / migration only. No API path, no policy |
| Verification badge | `professional_profiles.verification_status`, `verified_at` | `admin_set_verification()` (checks `is_admin()`) |
| Ratings, review counts | `professional_profiles.rating_avg`, `review_count` | server-side triggers (Phase 6); never owners |

## Permission matrix (current migrations)
`R` read, `C` create, `U` update (column-limited where noted), `D` delete, `-` no access. "own" = rows where the user id matches. Verified by `backend/tests`.

| Table | anon | authenticated (other) | owner | admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| governorates, cities, neighborhoods | R | R | R | R (writes by migration) |
| service_categories | R active | R active | R active | R all, C, U, D |
| profiles | - | - | R own; U `full_name, avatar_url, phone, preferred_language` | - |
| customer_profiles | - | - | R own; U `default_governorate_id, default_city_id` | - |
| admin_users | - | - | - | - (service role only) |
| professional_profiles | R published, **without** `contact_phone` / `verified_at` | R published incl. `contact_phone` | R own (draft too); U profile fields, `is_published` | R all; verification via RPC |
| professional_services, service_areas | R when profile published | R when profile published | R, C, D own | R as above |

Functions: `become_professional()` and `admin_set_verification()` are `SECURITY DEFINER` with a pinned `search_path`, executable by `authenticated` only (the second also checks `is_admin()`). `handle_new_user()` and `set_updated_at()` are not executable by clients.

## Privacy decisions
- `profiles.phone` and customer data are private to the owner. A professional's public contact is a separate column, hidden from anonymous visitors.
- Professional coordinates are rounded to 3 decimals (~110 m) by a trigger: approximate location only.
- A profile cannot be published unless it has a category, a description (>= 20 chars), a governorate and a contact phone.
- Deleting an auth user cascades to all their rows.

## How it is tested
`backend/tests` runs the real migrations on PGlite (Postgres compiled to WebAssembly) with a Supabase stub (roles, `auth.uid()`, the permissive default grants). Tests act as `anon` and as `authenticated` users with different JWT subjects. Structural guards fail the build if a new table lacks RLS, if the table or column privilege matrix drifts, if a definer function lacks a pinned `search_path`, or if function EXECUTE rights change. The suite was mutation-tested: removing a revoke, disabling RLS, widening a column grant, trusting metadata roles, un-pinning a search_path, exposing `contact_phone` and relaxing the publish check were each caught.

Limits: PGlite is not a full Supabase stack (no Auth service, Storage, PostGIS or realtime). Storage policies, Edge Functions and JWT handling need testing against a real Supabase project (blocked on issue #6). Seed names, especially Arabic, need native-speaker review.
